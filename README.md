# GranatumX_dev_2021


In this project repositary, we mainly import large research dataset from HCA, PanglaoDB, HTAN to GranatumX, and then chunk the datasets according to the memory need of each ML unit. 

We also modify each ML unit to run iteratively on the chunk dataset. Some algorithms are changed to deliver more precise result, such as Incremental PCA.
